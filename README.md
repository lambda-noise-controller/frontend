# Noise Controller

As a teacher, it can be hard to control the noise level in your classroom. You need an app that holds kids attention, and is sensitive to the noise level in the room to motivate them to stay quiet. This app will reveal unique animals only if it's quiet enough, keeping the kids quiet.
